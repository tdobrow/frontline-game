Frontline Game

Server / Client Interface:
todo: write

BUGS:
- a moves to b , b moves to c moves all of them. Unit moves need to be handled one at a time
- need to be able to click on an svg element to remove that action
- purchase shit so awkward
- handle

FIGURE OUT:
when I run into ssh issue I need to:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

TODO:
--
Combine unit and structure configs between frontend and backend without using some webpack shit

Unit pictures:
  - use the pictures directory
  - make the pictures not shit
  - picture per unit??
