Frontline Game

Server / Client Interface:
todo: write

BUGS:
- a moves to b , b moves to c moves all of them. Unit moves need to be handled one at a time
- purchase shit so awkward

FIGURE OUT:
when I run into ssh issue I need to:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

TODO:
--
Combine unit and structure configs between frontend and backend without using some webpack shit
